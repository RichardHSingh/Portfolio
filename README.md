# Portfolio

I chose to create a portfolio which showcases a little bit about myself in addition to some of the projects I have involved in. Reason for this that I believe that this could be something that employers could look into instead of going through my entire CV | LinkedIn | GitHub, whereas the portfolio will give an overall view of myself.
